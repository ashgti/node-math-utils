This is a library to add some mathmatics utlity functions
to Node.js.

Random Number Generators:
  Random(seed) -- uniformly distributed psuedo random number generator from [0.0, 1.0)
  UniformRandom(min, max, seed) -- generates uniformly distrubted random numbers from min to max
  ExponentialRandom(lambda, seed) -- generats an exponentially distributed random number from 0 to Inf but the mean is lambda.
